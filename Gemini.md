# Cardiology Inpatient Template Guide

As a new cardiology fellow, you can use these templates for your inpatient cardiology rotations. The list of relevant conditions is included in the `conditions.md` file. Templates should be in Markdown format and include the following sections:

## Template Sections
- **History**
- **Physical**
- **Labs**
- **Imaging**
- **Other Relevant Testing** (e.g., EKG, ECHO)
- **Management**
- **Follow-up**
- **Guidelines** â€“ with links and recent updates

A sample template for STEMI is included in the `Sample` folder as `STEMI.md`.
